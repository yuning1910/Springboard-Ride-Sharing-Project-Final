# Springboard-Ride-Sharing-Project-Final
Springboard Second Capstone Project - Ride Sharing Service Fee Estimation 

Introduction 
On March 28th, 2019,  San Francisco based ride hailing company Lyft became a public company via IPO.  It is expected that Lyft’s major competitor Uber will follow the suit to be IPO soon. Peer-to-peer ridesharing become an important part of people’s life everywhere. Ridesharing company implements a dynamic pricing model when calculating the trip cost. As an active ridesharing service customer, I have been interested in the pricing model those companies implemented for a while. The goal of this project is to develop a ridesharing service pricing model that allows customer like me to estimate the trip cost. 

Dataset
During my research for related data, I was lucky enough to discover that City of Chicago is the first city to release the ride hailing related data to public. Therefore, I was able to obtain Trip information from Chicago Data Portal. The actual dataset contains 17.4 million rows as the portal started to collect data from November, 2018. For this project, a random sample of 1 million rows were selected and loaded into Jupyter notebook. Dataset contains the following 21 features:

Trip ID
Trip Start Timestamp
Trip End Timestamp
Trip Seconds
